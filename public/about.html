      <p>**Past & Present Fusion**: My journey has been an evolution that encapsulates 
      diverse chapters. I began as a Software Developer, shaping client-server systems
      and desktop applications, steering the course of innovation with SQL, VB6, and C#.</p>

      <p>**A Gap Filled with Purpose**: From 05/2008 to 11/2020, my path took a pause – 
        not in ambition, but to embrace the profound role of fatherhood. As a devoted dad, 
        I stepped into the world of freelance software consulting and salesmanship. 
        My decision was simple yet profound: I wanted to be the steady presence in 
        my children's lives, managing their growth, their moments, and their needs. 
        The traditional 9-to-5 didn't align with this commitment, and so I embarked on 
        a journey where being my own boss became the gateway to nurturing my family while
        nurturing my professional dreams.
